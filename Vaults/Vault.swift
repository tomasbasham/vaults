/// Abstract vault protocol.
///
/// A store is an object containing all of the data for records loaded
/// from the persistence layer. It also acts as the interface between
/// your application and an instnace of `Adapter`
///
///     import Vaults
///
///     struct BaseVault<A: Adapter, T: Model>: Vault {
///
///       ...
///     }
///
/// An application will typically have a vault for each `Model` and
/// `Adapter` combination. This allows a logical separation between
/// model types which may have different storage requirements.
///
/// Because static stored properties are not supported in generics
/// types it is not possible to implement a singleton approach when
/// making a vault available in your application. Instead another
/// type is required to store the singleton.
///
///    import Vaults
///
///    struct KeyedArchiveVault: BaseVault<KeyedArchiveAdapter, Culture> {
///
///      static let shared = KeyedArchiveVault(KeyedArchiveAdapter(pathComponent: "culture"))
///    }
///
/// A store is an abstract base class that you should adopt in your
/// application to customise access to you persistence layer.
